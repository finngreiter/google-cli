# Google CLI
Have you ever been working on a project in your code editor and then had to Google something?
Now you can type `ggl 'cute kittens'` and it will open in your web browser!
Viola.

*woot*
HELP ME! I'VE NEVER USED A CLI BEFORE!
It's simple, just Clone this repository and double click on the installer.
After that open a terminal (or restart the one that is already open) and try these:
`ggl` (this always goes before anything you want to google) `ggl 'cue kittens'` (put what you want to search in single quotes.)
`ggl 'how do i code in python'`
`ggl 'youtube.com'`
*woot*

*This tool is under heavy development.*
